  <h1>Grassington in the Yorkshire Dales
    <br>aka<br>
     Darrowby in All Creatures Great and Small
  </h1>

<p>Grassington is a small market town in Upper Wharfedale, North Yorkshire with a population of
    just over 1000. It is a former lead mining village and its stone cottages 
    and busy cobbled square form a focal point for local and visitor activity.

<p>Grassington lies on the east side of the river Wharfe. On the west side is the village of Threshfield 
  where I live. The river can seem idyllic in summer, but can turn into a raging monster at almost any 
  time of year when in spate.

<p>Grassington was used as the setting for the fictional market town of Darrowby
  in the Channel 5 TV series of "All Creatures Great and Small". The first series was shown in
  2020 and several more followed. Surprising little needed to be done to
  transform the village square back to the late 1930s once the cars, modern shop fronts and satellite dishes
  had been removed or hidden. Filming of the latest series is due in March 2025 
  much to the delight or annoyance of the locals.

<p>My local pub - The Devonshire - or just the Dev as it is known locally was transformed into The Drover's Arms.
  The modern tarmac road surface in front of the pub was disguised using a mixture of straw and sand.

<p>Transformation of Skeldale House - the veterinary practice is in fact a private house.
